**Showcase of my master's thesis code**

This repository is a showcase of the current version of code that I developed during my Master's thesis.
This project is not finished and also not completely polished.

As the code was developed in a private repository and is only shown here, the repository does not have the relevant commit history and will not always be up to date.

If you are interested, please take a look at the post-graduation version of my thesis.
